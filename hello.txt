                                       to be in CS5990. In addition to completing the 30 hours of credit in approved courses
                                       (including CS5990 and up to 3 hours of CS5999 credit though not more than 9 total
                                       hours may be taken in CS5990 and CS5999), a student following the thesis option is
                                       expected to:

Prepare a written plan describing the thesis research.
Defend the research plan in an oral seminar presentation or meet with the advisory
                                          committee to discuss the research plan.
Prepare a final thesis.
Defend the thesis in an oral seminar presentation.

MS, Computer Science: Project Option



This option requires a report describing the results of an independent study project.
                                       The scope of the research topic should be defined in such a way that a full-time student
                                       could complete the requirements for a master’s degree in twelve months or three semesters
                                       following the completion of coursework by regularly scheduling graduate research credits. 
Of the minimum total of 30 credits, at least 24 must be earned in coursework other
                                       than the project:

I chose MTU for my graduate degree because of the great relationships I made with
                                       the professors in my undergrad. People actually care about you at MTU and you are
                                       not just a number. The welcoming environment at Computing[MTU] brings with it opportunities
                                       and a bright future.
